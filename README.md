# Machine learning working and modelling learning track start(20/7/2020) using Python.
## 1. Data Preprocessing
      In this module I learned importing modules, datasets, search and resolve missing values, OneHotEncoding and LabelEncoder for categorical data, splitting of dataset into train and test set, and last but not least Feature scaling methods i.e. Standardisation and Normalisation.
## 2. Simple Linear Regression
      In this module I used the Data Preprocessing techniques along with Simple Linear Regression and visualize the train and test results, also find out the coefficient and intercept of the equation y = b + b1 * x ( Here b1 = coefficient and b = intercept).
