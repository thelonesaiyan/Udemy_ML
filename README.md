# Machine learning working and modelling learning track start(20/7/2020) using Python.
## 1. Data Preprocessing
In this module I learned importing modules, datasets, search and resolve missing values, OneHotEncoding and LabelEncoder for categorical data, splitting of dataset into train and test set, and last but not least Feature scaling methods i.e. Standardisation and Normalisation.
## 2. Simple Linear Regression
In this module I used the Data Preprocessing techniques along with Simple Linear Regression and visualize the train and test results, also find out the coefficient and intercept of the equation y = b + b1 * x ( Here b1 = coefficient and b = intercept).
## 3. Multiple Linear Regression
In this module I learned about various multiple linear regression terms like Backward Elimination, Forward elimination , Bi-directionla elimination and applies the Linear regression module to train my model.
## 4. Polynomial Linear Regression
In this module I learned about polynomail linear regression and why its is linear expect the fact that it is non-linear regression technique. It is linear in terms of parammeters.
## 5. Support Vector Regressor
In this I learned about the SVR and its different kernals like 'rbf', 'poly', 'linear', etc. It is the first true non-linear regressor. Unlike other regressor that uses a single line it uses a box full of different lines to calculate the prediction. It doesn't work well with outliers but it trains the model more perfectly.
## 6. Decision Tree Regressor
In this I learned about the Decision Tree regressor and how it splits the data features and then uses the avg. mean of dependent variable to find the solution. It wirks just like tree it has a root represents the splits and leaf nodes as the results of those splits. It is used for higher degree of features not a best model for single independent feature dataset. There is no need for feature scaling in it.
